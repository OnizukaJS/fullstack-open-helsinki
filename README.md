# fullstack-open-helsinki

This course is proposed by the [University of Helsinki](https://github.com/OnizukaJS/fullstack-open-helsinki.git) and serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, the use of databases for storing the applicationâ€™s data amongst other things.

The course content is the same as in the Full stack course held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2023.

Participants are expected to have good programming skills, basic knowledge of web programming and databases, and to know the basics of working with the Git version-control system. You are also expected to have perseverance and the ability for independent problem solving and information seeking.
